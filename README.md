***Modified*** Figure 4: Performance comparison of RPP against Badnets backdoor attacks with perturbation magnitude 
$\|\delta\|_2 \geq 0.8$, measured by TPR and FPR across balanced datasets ($\rho = 1$), and varying 
imbalance ratios ($\rho = 2, 10, 100, 200$) with $n = 100$ for different $\alpha$ values on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
